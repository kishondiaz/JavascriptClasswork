       JavaScript is a client side scripting language that can do amazing things with html and css and there are many libraries, and plugins to make life easier when it comes to scripting. It is a part of a set of language html, css, and JavaScript, and they are called the trifecta of web development.  I enjoy programming and was very happy taking this class it helped me understands JavaScript more being that I was self-taught. Now I feel I can do a lot more with this understanding of JavaScript the possibilities are endless, and with this endless possibilities I plan on doing great things.

      JavaScript is a client side language that runs on the client side or personal computers of companies and everyday people like you and me. This language s works great together with html and css, and javascprit is implemented into a lot of other language s and some are used in conjunctions with JavaScript. Html is the scripting that form the website, css is the paint that makes the site looks pretty; JavaScript is the brains behind the outfit and makes things happen behind the scenes. Language s like Php, python, ruby, java, c# are usually implement with the  trifecta to make sites more robust and allow access to sever side storage into databases. JavaScript is multi-platform alongside the other pieces of the  trifecta works on most to all platforms such as cell phones like iPhone, android, windows, and on client side Operating  System like windows, Linux, apple, and on their browsers that that run on these platforms like IE, Edge, browser, Firefox, chrome and more. JavaScript is also has a fun side it is used to make games even though JavaScript is not A-Synchronist  it can be used to create amazing games. For a long time it was used as the staple of Unity game development platform software that millions of Indie game developers use, and with libraries like webgl and built in html5 canvas making games have never been so easy.

      I have spent a lot of time self -teaching myself programming, but nothing beats learning from a professor, and being able to ask someone helps out allot. Before this client-side class I just understood how to use JavaScript minimally and only understood how to use the language to make things happen on a html page, but know I have the a boarder understanding of JavaScript now, and with this knowledge I  will expand and grow. Even though I believe in these skills I have now with ever growing confidence I want to learn more about JavaScript and its libraries I want to prefect my jQuery understanding, and so this is where it will begin.
      What I plan on doing in the future is to start my own company using the knowledge I obtained using JavaScript, and other language s. Webextensions use JavaScript to create Webextensions for browsers , I plan on create applications and products for customers to use on their browsers and on their phones. Android is a great platform the only issue with it is google deprecates its code to fast and the learning curb is steeper than ever before. With this knowledge I can now build better android, iPhone webapplications that use html, css, JavaScript, and still be able to interface with the native android and iPhone api to create beautiful flowing apps that without worry of deprecation, because the beautiful thing about html, css, and JavaScript they solemnly deprecate code and itâ€™s not as rapid as in to the way google does there code. I also have learned how to build robots I plan on building worker bot for companies to help with work like at Home Depot, Lowes, hotels, and such using JavaScript and the rest of the trifecta I can create an easy to use interacts for my customers to interact with their service bots, and manage them easier without having to install any software. I also plan on making some online game some for  fun and some for profit using JavaScript and the library webgl  I want to make cross platform games with this knowledge that I have obtained, and I thank all the professors that have helped me to this point, because of their hard work I know have greater understanding . With that said there is a saying with knowledge you have power to change the world and I hoop that one day I may change the world because of JavaScript and all the knowledge that I have obtained.
