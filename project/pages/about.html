      Services I Provide:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>I think of myself as a programmer</li>

        <li>I can build robotics</li>
      </ul>
      
      How did I Learn my Services: <br>
      <p>As a programmer I learned programming from being self-taught and practice every night for 3 years on my own thins later learned from great professors from Broward College. 
      </p>
      <p>I taught myself through tutorials and practice I took apart my first computer when I was 12 years old of course I didnâ€™t get it back together then but I learned about tower computers back then now I have fixed over 6 computers built my own tower, and as for the phones and tablets I have learned through the same methods I have fixed 4 phones and 1 tablets. 
      </p>
      <p>As for my service of building robotics is more like a flourishing service I do have experience in avionics, but as for robotics I have only built one robot, I am in the process of building a 3d printer and this will be a service I will provide in the future.   
      </p>
      
      Years of services: <br>
      <p>Over all i would say less then 5 years but eveything has been more of the lines of practice.</p>
